A discord bot that allows you to have to verify via captcha to maintain within the server. Failure to do so will result in a kick. If you do not complete the captcha correctly you will get another attempt. There is no limit on attempts and it is case sensitve. This bot is to help preventing your server from getting raided, botted and or fake discord accounts from joining.
